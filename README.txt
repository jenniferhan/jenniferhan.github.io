1. I was able to correctly implement a homepage (index.html) with two links
that lead to an "About Me" page (bio.html/bio.css) and a "Resume" page
(resume.html). Running these files with the W3 validator results in no errors.

2. Thanks to Ming for your help on uploading my image onto the homepage
& fixing some layout issues. I also discussed syntax issues with other
students in the class.

3. I spent approximately 10 hours on this assignment.
